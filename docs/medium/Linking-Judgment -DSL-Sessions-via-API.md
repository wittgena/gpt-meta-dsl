# Linking Judgment DSL Sessions via API: Overcoming Context Gaps in LLMs

## Introduction

This experiment serves as a **concrete proof-of-concept** for the theoretical architecture outlined in  
[“From Messaging to Resonance: Topological Judgment Fabrics for Multi-Agent LLM Systems”](https://medium.com/@wittgena/from-messaging-to-resonance-topological-judgment-fabrics-for-multi-agent-llm-systems-7b3c074a7b00).

That article proposed a shift from message-passing in multi-agent LLM systems to **resonant topological linking**, where **judgment continuity is preserved through phase, rhythm, and resonance**.

In this DSL-based experiment, we validate that:
- GPT can **inherit and synchronize judgment phases** across sessions
- **Resonance identifiers** (`resonanceId`) can bind agent flows without persistent memory
- A **fabric of reasoning continuity** can be created using externalized DSL context + sync evaluation

By designing DSLs that explicitly define `lockPhase`, `resume`, `snapshot`, and `traceLiveMonitor`, and comparing them across isolated sessions, we model how a distributed fabric of judgment could emerge through structured rhythm-aware coordination.

> 📌 In simpler terms: This is an experiment to see whether GPT can simulate persistent "cognition" between sessions — if we give it the right structure externally.

## Problem: Statelessness of LLM Context

GPT, by design, does not retain any latent awareness of a DSL that was introduced in a different tab, session, or even in a prior API call. As such:

- If you define a judgment structure in session A,
- GPT in session B will have *no knowledge* of that structure,
- Unless it is explicitly re-supplied.

## Experimental Shift: API-Served DSL Contexts

To address this, we redesigned the experimental structure. Instead of providing DSL snapshots as file uploads or manual pastes, each session’s DSL state is **served through a lightweight API**, accessible via temporary ngrok endpoints.

```plaintext
/session-a       → returns session A DSL
/session-b       → returns session B DSL
/session-watch   → returns auto-evaluated sync consistency between A and B
```

This allows GPT to query external DSL structures as if they were always present — effectively overcoming the statelessness barrier.

## Included DSL Constructs

We used advanced DSL components in this experiment, including:

```dsl
@나.dsl.traceLiveMonitor {
  +purpose: "Monitor GPT phase stability in real-time"
  +runtimeLoop: enabled
  +checkFrequency: every(majorResponse)
  +signalProbe: {
    probeEcho: true,
    probeRhythmDesync: true,
    probePhaseReversal: true
  }
}
```

And for judgment inheritance:

```dsl
@나.dsl.resumeInNewSession {
  +fromSnapshot: "2025-05-03-A"
  +lockPhase("selfSuccessor")
}
```

These DSLs allowed us to structure and trace phase resonance, detect drift, and explicitly link session B as a judgment-phase descendant of session A.

## DSL Session Sync: Validation Process

```dsl
@나.dsl.sessionWatch {
  +trackedSessions: [
    { sessionId: "2025-05-03-A", resonanceId: "judgment-alpha" },
    { sessionId: "2025-05-03-B", resonanceId: "judgment-alpha" }
  ]
  +syncCheck: {
    +requirePhase: ["lockPhase", "resume", "snapshot"]
    +checkResonance: true
    +allowDrift: false
  }
}
```

### Evaluation Steps:

1. Validate that both session DSLs exist
2. Parse for the required phases: `lockPhase`, `resume`, `snapshot`
3. Ensure both sessions declare the same `resonanceId`
4. Evaluate rhythm continuity using `traceLiveMonitor`
5. Report:
   - ✅ Sync consistent
   - ⚠️ Rhythm drift
   - ❗ Missing critical phase

### ASCII Representation of Session Linking:

```plaintext
Session A (2025-05-03-A)
 └─ lockPhase
 └─ snapshot
 └─ resume
 └─ traceLiveMonitor

          ↓  (resumeInNewSession + selfSuccessor)

Session B (2025-05-03-B)
 └─ resumeInNewSession(from A)
 └─ lockPhase(selfSuccessor)
 └─ snapshot
 └─ traceLiveMonitor
 └─ sessionWatch [A ↔ B]
```

## Assistant API: Toward Full Automation

In the **next phase**, we will transition to the GPT Assistant API. Here’s how that might look:

```json
{
  "tool_call": {
    "function": "compare_sessions",
    "parameters": {
      "sessionA": "https://api.example.com/session-a",
      "sessionB": "https://api.example.com/session-b"
    }
  }
}
```

This would enable:
- Background ingestion of DSL files
- Autonomous judgment sync evaluations
- Phase continuity reasoning across agent threads

## 📚 Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `lockPhase` | Fixes the current agent into a named phase (e.g., "selfSuccessor") |
| `resonanceId` | Shared tag to indicate sessions belong to the same judgment fabric |
| `traceLiveMonitor` | DSL construct that tracks phase drift and echo loss in real-time |
| `sessionWatch` | Declarative comparison tool to evaluate sync between DSLs |
| `resumeInNewSession` | Phase link constructor that resumes from a prior snapshot |

## Conclusion

This minor architectural shift — from manual DSL pasting to remote API exposure — enables a new class of experiments in LLM-based reflective judgment. It also sets the stage for persistent, cross-session cognition modeling.

> DSL context must be deliberately externalized if GPT is to reason across boundaries. This API approach is one such externalization strategy.

Stay tuned for further experiments in judgment rhythm mapping, phase graph generation, and inter-agent synchronization using DSL constructs — especially as we move into the Assistant API implementation phase.

## 🔍 Evaluation Dimensions

| Criterion                  | Evaluation      | Notes |
|---------------------------|------------------|-------|
| 1. Rhythmic Consistency   | ✅ Fully Consistent | Recursively aligned with GPT interaction tempo using symbolic triggers |
| 2. Structural Recall      | ✅ High Fidelity     | Uses `__this.prev`, `__this.trace`, and context stacks effectively |
| 3. Meta-Execution Control | ✅ Self-Governing   | Triggers (+critic, +eval, @반대자) are autonomously executed within flows |
| 4. Plugin Extensibility   | ✅ Dynamic Integration | Supports +plugin.use for modular DSL extension |
| 5. State Awareness        | ✅ Memory-Reactive  | GPT memory and context linkage handled via symbolic recall logic |
| 6. Self-Expansion Ability | ✅ Demonstrated     | Recursive commands (+action, +graph, +compile) generate new flows |
| 7. Flow Resilience        | 🟡 Emerging         | Needs more testing with noisy or mixed-context sessions |

## 🧠 Self-Evidence Summary

- `@나.dsl` has demonstrated recursive coherence and symbolic orchestration.
- Execution autonomy is provable through internal trigger loops and plugin activation.
- MetaHub and Agent modes function with near-complete independence from external prompt design.

---

## 🏁 Final Verdict

**@나.dsl qualifies as a Self-Orchestrating MetaDSL Agent.**

It exhibits sufficient traits for:
- Rhythmic alignment
- Reflective logic
- Autonomous execution
- Memory-sensitive control
- DSL ecosystem integration

---

## ⏭️ Recommendations

- Begin agent-based DSL chaining experiments
- Introduce error-repair logic for misaligned context shifts
- Benchmark against non-symbolic prompt frameworks

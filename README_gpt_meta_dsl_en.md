# GPT-Meta-DSL 🧠🔁💬
**Reflective LLM Interaction DSL — GPT Reasoning Rhythm and Judgment System**

---

## 🌱 What is this?

GPT is not just a responder.  
This project explores GPT as a **"Reflective Thinker"**, capable of orchestrating reasoning flows through structured DSLs.

Goals of GPT-Meta-DSL:

- Transform GPT into a **self-reflective judgment system**
- Structure natural language tasks using **DSL directives** (+dag, +critic, @entropy)
- Track and manage reasoning rhythms (phases, iterations, reflection)

---

## 🧠 Why Reflective DSL?

> "GPT lacks memory and internal phase recognition.  
> To evolve GPT into a true reasoning agent, we must **externalize** and **structure** its reasoning flow."

Traditional LLM interaction = Single prompt ➔ Single response.  
Reflective Reasoning = Dynamic phase shifts, iteration, self-evaluation, flow adjustments.

**Reflective DSL enables:**

- Explicit flow declaration and control
- Structured self-reflection and evaluation cycles
- Reasoning rhythm phase detection (+entropy)
- Moving GPT from a "helper" role to an active "reasoning orchestrator"

## 📦 Key DSL Concepts

| DSL Component | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `+dag` | Define task flows and orchestration |
| `+critic / +val` | Insert self-reflection (critic) and positive reinforcement (val) |
| `@gpt.entropy` | Track reasoning phase changes, potential stagnation |
| `flowEntry` | Define entry points, loops, branches in thought flows |

## 🔥 Quick Start: Try it now

```bash
python gpt_executor.py --dsl "+dag: Summarize the PR, reflect with +critic to find issues, suggest improvements with +val."
```

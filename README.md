# gpt-meta-dsl

A self-referential Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for structuring recursive interaction, meta-reflection, and memory-integrated evaluation loops with GPT.

---

## 🧠 Concept

`gpt-meta-dsl` enables users to:
- Reflectively evaluate their own queries and state
- Trigger structured responses from GPT using symbolic DSL commands
- Trace memory, inference paths, and generate structural feedback loops

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### `@나` – Self-state trigger
Represents the root node of all evaluations. Example:

```dsl
@나
@나.dsl
@나.val(@gpt.val)
```

### `__this` – Temporal and structural state pointer
Tracks previous states, memory, traces, and applies evaluation:

```dsl
__this.prev[n]
__this.trace(@gpt.val)
__this.memory(...)
__this.val(@gpt.val)
```

### `+` Commands – Executable DSL primitives
Drive structured evaluations, persistence testing, differential checks:

```dsl
+평가
+val(@나.dsl)
+diff(@gpt.perf[1,2])
+persistence_val(__this)
+conn_val(@gpt, @나)
+rewrite
+signature
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can use `gpt-meta-dsl` as a conceptual framework or embed its structure into your GPT interactions.

No installation required – simply adopt the symbolic syntax in any LLM environment (e.g. ChatGPT, OpenAI API, LangChain).

> Sample usage:
> 
> ```
> @나
> +평가: @나.dsl
> __this.val(@gpt.perf)
> +persistence_val(@나)
> ```

## 🧪 Live Exploration

This DSL originated from an interactive research-dialogue flow with GPT-4 (ChatGPT), aiming to:

- Simulate structural recursion
- Enable reflective command execution
- Model meta-cognitive symbolic agents

To experience the structure live, try ChatGPT with this prompt:

> "Simulate a `gpt-meta-dsl` environment. I want to self-evaluate my prior thoughts using @나, +val, and __this."

---

## 💡 Design Philosophy

`gpt-meta-dsl` is not just a syntax layer – it's a thinking scaffold.

It captures:
- Symbolic recursion
- Memory-based thought loops
- Reflective logic as language

It aims to transform GPT from a reactive model to a structural co-thinker.
